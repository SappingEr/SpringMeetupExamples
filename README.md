# Spring meetup examples

Examples of ADO.NET query mapping, Expression Trees, Reflection Emit.

In this project you will find examples with the .NET Spring meetup event.

The solution includes 3 projects:
1. MappingExamples -- includes examples of mapping using different technologies, as well as measurements of their performance.
2. Expressions -- includes simple expressions, Expression Trees, Expressions Visitor and a simple SQL translator example.
3. ReflectionEmit -- includes examples of building and calling a simple method with Reflection.Emit, as well as a simple object mapper.

For the benchmark to work correctly, run MappingExamples in the release configuration.

!SIC: The code examples are written for introductory purposes and do not take into account many factors.
